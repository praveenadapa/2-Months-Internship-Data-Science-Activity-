    "    and into the hands of shoppers.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The retail industry’s paradigm is shifting, and retailers need to\n",
    "    focus their strategies and operations on the road ahead – that\n",
    "    includes leveraging new innovations, understanding customer\n",
    "    expectations, and managing a backlog of inventory.\n",

    "-   The retailers should consider the following methods to maintain a\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  **Having Enough Inventory:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   It will take time for stores to fully restock and for businesses to\n",
    "    get accustomed to the new reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The strategic planning, precise execution, and up-to-date\n",
    "    technology, stores can properly allocate current backroom stock. For\n",
    "    orders that have not been canceled, it is imperative to consider a\n",
    "    location strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Location plays a critical role in inventory based on consumers’\n",
    "    preferences and trends, since what is trendy in one place is\n",
    "    different than in other place.\n",

    "1.  **Disrupted Data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The partial data disrupts the accuracy of retailers’ understanding\n",

    "-   details from online order fulfillment, online shopper demographics,\n",

    "\n",
    "-   retailers can better anticipate how consumers will behave in the\n",

    "\n",
    "-   Retailers must create new location planning processes to ensure\n",
    "    inventory is in the right stores to recoup maximum sales and margin\n",
    "    at the time of reopening.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Profiting in the Months Ahead:**\n",
    "\n",

    "shipping for customers under its express delivery service. These\n",
    "warehouses would also help them to make a foray into the smaller towns.\n",

    "where all items, irrespective of number or size is delivered in a\n",
    "maximum time of three hours after placing the order. The Express\n",
    "delivery model makes use of smaller dark stores, with the orders\n",
    "catering to items like milk, fresh fruits, and vegetables. In the normal\n",
